# pokemon-yellow-hyper-randomizer
Randomizes rom data to generate new and strange Pokemon

# How to use:
Run main.py using Python 3+ in the same folder with a file named "Pokemon - Yellow Version.gbc".
It will create a new file named "output.gbc" which is the shiny new randomized rom to run in your emulator of choice.

# TODO:
* Use cheksum to verify rom instead of title
* Randomize sprites (or something about them at least)
* Fix name generation when packaged (?)
* Test evolution & make it more logical
